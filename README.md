Inertial lift force helper class for curved trapezoidal ducts.

This provides a minimal interface to stripped research data relating to particle migration in curved microfluidic ducts having a trapezoidal cross-section. It utilises a model first described in our Journal of Fluid Mechanics paper (https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2019.323) and relates to a manuscript soon to be submitted for peer review (pre-print details to come soon). Initially a Python interface is provided, but a MATLAB interface may also be provided in future if there is demand.

I would appreciate it if you get in touch and to let me know if you use this code/data. I'm more than happy to provide assistance to help you get started with using these classes and the associated data.  Please ensure you cite our work if you use this code/data.
